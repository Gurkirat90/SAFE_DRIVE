Because GitHub does not allow uploads larger than 25 MB, I’m sharing the Google Drive link instead.  
**Link:** [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A0oLUqlIT-jEOa3M406qRd0B0UDb38ua?usp=sharing)

Inside the shared folder, there are two subfolders:

1. **distracted_driver_vgg16_best.pth** → This model is specifically trained to detect driver distractions from the **right side view**.
2. **dfl3d_best_model_optimized.pth** → This model is specifically trained to detect driver drowsiness from the **front view**.

You can also find the code used to train this model in the **"CODES" folder** of this repository, or access it directly via [CODE FILE](https://github.com/Gurkirat90/SAFE_DRIVE/CODES).
