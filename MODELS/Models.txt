Because GitHub does not allow uploads larger than 25 MB, I’m sharing the Google Drive link instead.
Link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AOolUqlIT-jEOa3M4O6qRd0B0UDb38ua?usp=sharing]

Inside the shared folder, there are two subfolders:
1.	distracted_driver_vgg16_best.pth → This model is specifically trained to detect driver distractions from the right side view.
2.	dfl3d_best_model_optimized.pth → This model is specifically trained to detect driver drowsiness from the front view.
You can also find the code used to train this model in the code folder of this repository, or access it directly via https://github.com/Gurkirat90/SAFE_DRIVE/CODES
