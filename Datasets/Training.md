Because GitHub does not allow uploads larger than 25 MB, I’m sharing the Google Drive link instead:
**Link:** [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FmozCYCFMTV-l_ol3TB3t79OyKng1LK9?usp=sharing)

Inside the shared folder, you will find two files:
1. **archive.zip** → Contains data specifically for detecting driver drowsiness.
2. **dfl3d_best_model_optimized.pth** → Pre-trained model specifically for detecting driver distraction.

You can also find the code used to train these models in the **"CODES" folder** of this repository, or access it directly via [this link](https://github.com/Gurkirat90/SAFE_DRIVE/main/CODES)..

For convenience, the trained models (which are large in size) are available in the **"MODELS" folder** of this repository, or you can access them directly via [this link](https://github.com/Gurkirat90/SAFE_DRIVE/main/MODELS).
